## Try to automate the preprocessing step for the better understanding of data before you build your model for ML, DL, OpenCV projects.

## ü§ñ AutoML Visualizer 

- AutoML Visualizer is a web-based platform that streamlines **machine learning workflows** by automating data preprocessing, model training, and result visualization. Designed for both beginners and professionals,    this tool makes it easier to understand, visualize, and debug ML pipelines.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Flask
- **Web Server:** Gunicorn
- **ML Engine:** EvalML, Pandas
- **Validation:** Pydantic
- **Environment Handling:** python-dotenv
- **Testing:** Pytest
- **Custom Library:** [`atlantica`](https://github.com/Atharvaud29/AutoML-Visualizer) (installed via Git)

## üéØ Project Outcome

1. End-to-End ML Pipeline Automation
   - Users can upload a raw CSV dataset and receive:
       - Cleaned and transformed data
       - A trained ML model
       - Visual insights on model performance
   - No manual preprocessing or model selection required.
  
2. Seamless User Experience
   - CSV upload
   - Clear visual feedback on preprocessing steps
   - Visualization of ML evaluation results
  
3. Robust Preprocessing Engine
   - Automatically handles:
        - Missing values
        - Categorical encoding
        - Feature scaling
   - Ensures consistent preprocessing across datasets.

4. AutoML Model Evaluation
    - Select the best-performing model based on metrics
